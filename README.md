## 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various input features using Machine Learning. to interactively test predictions.


## 📌 Project Overview

House price prediction is a common regression problem in Machine Learning.
In this project, a trained ML model takes house-related features as input and predicts the estimated price.

The project covers:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Model evaluation
* Web deployment using Streamlit


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
* **Streamlit** (for web app)
* **Google Colab**
* **GitHub**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Train a regression model (Linear Regression / Random Forest, etc.)
3. Save the trained model 
4. User enters house details
5. Model predicts the house price
